# gamebox

Welcome to my personal gamebox repository! This is where I keep a collection of simple, fun mini-games that I enjoy playing and tinkering with. Think of it as my little arcade corner, built with Python. I'm constantly adding new ideas and refining existing ones, so expect this repository to be updated quite often!

## The Games Inside

Currently, my gamebox features three classic mini-games:

### Battle Game

This is a straightforward turn-based battle game where two players face off. Each player starts with 100 health points (HP) and takes turns attacking. Attacks deal a random amount of damage (between 10 and 20 HP), making each turn a little unpredictable. The goal is simple: be the last one standing when your opponent's HP drops to zero! It's a quick and engaging way to settle a friendly dispute.

### Tic-Tac-Toe

The timeless classic! Play against a friend on a 3x3 grid, aiming to get three of your marks (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal. It's a simple game of strategy and anticipation that's always fun for a quick match.

### Rock Paper Scissors

The ultimate decision-making game, or just a fun way to pass the time! It's the classic hand game where you choose between stone, paper, or scissors, and try to outwit your opponent. Quick rounds, simple rules, and endless fun.

## How to Play

All games in this gamebox are built with Python and CPP, and designed to run in your terminal or preferred IDE.

What's Next?

As I mentioned, this gamebox is a living project for my amusement. I plan to:

    Add more mini-games to expand the collection.

    Refine existing games with new features or improved gameplay.

    Experiment with different Python libraries for potential UI enhancements.

Stay tuned for more updates!
